+ Project summary: In this project, the objective is to optimize the predictive ability with the low computational expense. The dataset is a public Kaggle financial loan data. In order to check the improvements, I decided to utilize a logistice regression as the baseline model. However, becasue of the classification output, the logistice model is also a popular way to make a reliable prediction, especially with more parameters. In addition to the prediction part, the variable selection is essential to build a model. With the business understanding and statistical methods, 25 variables were chosen including dependent variable. The criteria is to achieve both high accuracuy and recall so that the loan is likely to be paid in full, when reviewing loan applications. The raw data is shareable withe link
